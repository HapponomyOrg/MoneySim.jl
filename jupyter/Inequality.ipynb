    "## Abstract\n",
    "According to the latest reports from the World Bank, the OECD and Oxfam, inequality within countries is on the rise again. Even though there are some notable exceptions, such as Europe, where inequality has been decreasing, the level of inequality is higher than expected across the board. These levels of inequality have devastating effects on society at large, and it seems very plausible that current measures to bring the level of inequality down are inadequate, and in many cases are failing to be effective.  \n",
    "This paper starts by giving an overview of the effects of high inequality on society, democracy and well-being of the different layers of the population, before exploring the most likely systemic causes of the persistence of this inequality. This exploration looks into results from economical, psychological, sociological and neurological research in order to create a systemic overview of forces at play.  \n",
    "It will be shown that current economic and political constructs are inadequate to address high levels of inequality in an adequate way and that there is a need for a structural methodology that inherently reduces inequality, and that is shielded as much as possible from ideology based politics. This paper proposes to tackle the problem through a monetary policy that inherently redistributes monetary wealth, and consistently pushes towards, but never reaches, full equality. This proposition is then analyzed in order to determine its advantages and disadvantages. These are then compared to the current post-Keynesian monetary policy.  \n",
    "In the last part of the paper, these findings are reintegrated with the results from the other research fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the aspects this paper wants to bring to light is the necessity for interdisciplinary research, and especially collaboration between economists, psychologists, sociologists, political scientists, and neurologists in order to get a better grasp on economic events and mechanisms."

    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "Economic equality refers to the fair distribution of wealth, resources, and opportunities within a society, and is considered a fundamental aspect of social justice and fairness (Rawls, 2005; Valentini, 2012). The pursuit of economic equality is rooted in the belief that all individuals should have access to necessities, opportunities for advancement, and a reasonable standard of living, thereby providing them with an equitable chance to succeed and prosper, regardless of their socioeconomic background or circumstances. From a moral and ethical standpoint, the concept of economic equality is often linked to principles of distributive justice, that emphasize the fair allocation of resources and benefits within society, and can thus be considered to be worth striving for. \n",
    "\n",
    "As Piketty has stated in his book, A Brief History of Equality (Piketty, 2022), decreasing inequality requires constant vigilance, and, when left unattended, inequality has a tendency to increase.\n",
    "\n",
    "From a systems thinking perspective (Meadows, 2009), that means there must be one or more reinforcing feedback loops related to inequality in our socio-economic system. Left unchecked, reinforcing feedback loops are detrimental for any system, and it is therefore paramount that these loops are identified and interventions are made in order to counter their effects. It is the goal of this paper to do just that; identify at least the most obvious reinforcing feedback loops and propose a systemic intervention that would transform them into balancing feedback loops.\n",
    " \n",
    "Econophysics has identified such a feedback loop in the yard sale asset exchange model. In asset exchange models random agents exchange wealth according to a specified set of rules. In the yard sale model, the amount of wealth that is exchanged is dependant on the wealth of the poorest agent while the direction of the wealth exchange is determined by a fair coin flip. Independent of initial setup, execution of this model invariably leads to all wealth being concentrated with a single actor. This is due to a subtle bias that works in favor of the wealthiest agent in the model. Although the chance of winning in any transaction is equal for both agents, the wealthier agent looses a proportionally smaller part of their wealth in case of a loss compared to the poorer agent. Thereby putting a higher downward pressure on every agent's wealth, except for the wealthiest.\n",
    "\n",
    "Real world wealth inequality is not as extreme as this simple model suggests, indicating it is too simple. Governments have implemented redistribution measures through progressive taxation, social welfare programs, and initiatives to promote access to education and employment opportunities, aimed at reducing income and wealth disparities. Further research as shown that, when these measures are added to the model, the results are within acceptable error margins of real world inequality.\n",
    "\n",
    " in many countries across the world income and wealth inequality have been on the rise over the past few decades (Wolff, 1996; OECD, 2015; Zucman, 2019; Cantante, 2020; Meyer and Sullivan, 2023; Zhuang, 2023). Moreover, the levels of inequality that are observed today are considered to be excessive (Norton and Ariely, 2011; Peterson, 2017).\n",
    "mentioned above are applied to these models, they reproduce current inequality data within acceptable error margins.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite these redistribution measures, inequality is still on the rise and are therefore deemed inadequate to tackle this issue on a systemic level. This paper introduces a systemic solution based on the alternative monetary system presented in Kuypers, 2024."

    "## 2. Methodology\n",
    "A worst case implementation of the yard sale model is taken as the baseline against which to test the proposed solution. It favors the wealthier actors and generates absolute inequality when no redistributive measures are taken. It is therefore assumed that, if the proposed solution can reduce inequality to an acceptable level in this worst-case scenario, the solution would also adequately work in a real world environment that is less brutal.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to map the evolution of the model to a relevant time frame, the GDP per capita of Belgium in 2023 is used to determine how many transactions take place over the time span of a  year. The year \"ends\" when the sum of the transactions exceeds the product of the number of actors in the simulation with the GDP per capita. That way it can be determined how long it would take until full inequality would be reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "A computational model is built with the goal of testing wether the proposed systemic solution is capable of countering the effect of this simple yard sale model."

    "## 3. Identifying reinforcing feedback loops\n",
    "Most of the research that has been found on this topic deals with income and consumption inequality, and not directly with wealth inequality. When part of the population has an income that is more than sufficient to cover the cost of living, it is assumed that income inequality inherently leads to wealth inequality because the availability of income that does not need to be spent on the cost of living is available to acquire capital, and thus increased wealth. This acquired capital potentially generates surplus income, thereby exacerbating income inequality, and thus wealth inequality. This reinforcing feedback loop is known as the Matthew effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is reflected in Piketty's conclusion on wealth and power in his book \"Capital in the 21st Century\" (Piketty and Goldhammer, 2017) where he emphasizes the inherent characteristic of rising wealth and wealth inequality in capitalist economies. He argues that this trend is driven by the fact that the rate of return on capital ($r$) exceeds the growth rate of the economy ($g$), leading to a continuous increase in wealth inequality over time (Piketty, 2015; Madsen, 2017).\n",
    "\n",
    "There exists a wealth transfer dynamic, modeled by the yard sale model[^1], that concentrates wealth in the hands of an ever diminishing portion of the participants. Perpetual evaluation of the model results in all the wealth being in the hands of a single actor. It appears that the wealth concentration dynamic of the yard-sale model is active in the current-day free market economy, albeit with adjustments from redistribution measures implemented by governments (Boghosian, 2014; Boghosian et al., 2016; Vallejos et al., 2018). This dynamic might be partially explained by the bargaining advantage the wealthy have over the poor (Jeong, 2013), but it might also be influenced by what people assume what a person needs and/or deserves. This is influenced by the worldview of the one making the assessment (Dromi, 2012; Khatry et al., 2021; Waldfogel et al., 2021). Whatever the cause, it is undeniable that this is a reinforcing dynamic that increases inequality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Socio-economic shocks, such as the 2008 financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic, mainly affect vulnerable groups (Pfeffer et al., 2013; Compton et al., 2018; Van Bavel and Scheffer, 2021; Perry et al., 2021; Popyk and Pustułka, 2023), thereby widening the wealth and opportunity gap. Taking the research of Mullainathan and Shafir (Mullainathan and Shafir, 2021) into account, the latter is not surprising because affluent groups have a larger financial buffer with which to withstand the effects of those socio-economic shocks, and they are not prone to the cognitive limitations that result from living in financial scarcity, and are therefore more likely to take better strategical decisions. Systemic research has identified 151 bank crises, 236 currency crises and 75 sovereign debt crises worldwide between 1970 and 2017 (Laeven and Valencia, 2018), an interplay link has been established between credit money and macroeconomic instability (Cincotti et al., 2010; Kuypers et al., 2021), and historic research has indicated that debt with interest, which is the basis of our current-day monetary system, inevitably results in nonpayable debt in slow or non-growing economies (Hartley and Kallis, 2021). From this it can be concluded that socio-economic shocks are not exceptions and that they can be included within the category of systemic reinforcing feedback loops vis-a-vis inequality.\n",
    "\n",
    "The various monetary policies implemented by central banks have a varying effect on inequality. Contractionary policies clearly seem to have a positive effect on income inequality (Coibion et al., 2017; Mumtaz and Theophilopoulou, 2017; Creel and El Herradi, 2024). Quantitative easing (QE) also seems to contribute to increased inequality (Mumtaz and Theophilopoulou, 2017). The latter might be caused by the fact that the money created by QE has a higher probability to end up in the hand of the affluent through inflated financial asset prices. \n",

    "## 3. Power and wealth and their influence on moral decision-making\n",
    "What is understood by power varies (Guinote, Vescio, 2010, chapter 1). Although it is beyond the scope of this paper to go into detail on all the different aspects and intricacies of power, it is deemed important to clarify what is meant by power in the context of what follows. Power is defined as the capacity to have, either directly or indirectly, a measurable influence on the outcome of a situation or process. This power is situated on a scale ranging from absolute, where the power holder does not need to take the desires of those who are impacted into account, to consensual, where the power is a consequence of consent by those subject to it, and thus can be taken away. Two dimensions of power are adopted: personal power, that is the ability to act, and/or agency (Ng, 1980; Russel, 1938; Thibaut, Kelley, 1959), and social power (), that is the power held over others. For the rest of the paper, power is used when referring to social power.\n",
    "\n",
    "When thinking about political leadership, it stands to reason that ethics and morality should play an important role in decision-making. In a perfect democracy, political power would be fully consensual, and facilitate a society where well-being and prosperity, within the sustainability boundaries of what our planet can support, for all current and future generations would be top priority. The current day reality is that political corruption, and power abuse still cause massive societal problems and geopolitical tension. Wars are still raging. We still fail to adequately tackle climate change, and biodiversity crises. Inequality is still at an unacceptable level. This presents the world with a wicked problem for which there are no simple solution, but exposing some systemic leverage points should provide a means to start shifting things in a direction that would be beneficial for all. The question that is put on the table is which systemic aspects of our current day world help or hinder moral and ethical decision-making.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Very wealthy families and individuals manage to gather large amounts of economic power, often through pyramidal control structures and power networks, that in turn leads to increased political influence (Morck et al., 2004; Maclean et al., 2010; Rossi, 2014), and thus more power. According to a small scale survey on the political preferences of the very wealthy, these people seem to have a tendency to support conservative policies, and are more inclined to oppose structural redistribution programs (Page et al., 2013). This can potentially lead towards an entrenchment of the wealthy in political power positions that can make it difficult to effectively create needed political change that would go against the vested interest of those holding these power seats (Acemoglu and Robinson, 2008). In the US these dynamics lead to the average citizen having near zero effect on policy decisions, if their interests oppose the interests of the economic elites (Tahoun and Van Lent, 2019), and it can thus be concluded that the power of economic elites in the US is near absolute. These dynamics are a clear threat to democracy, and, considering the vested interests of, for example, fossil fuel companies, hinder necessary action that would allow us to move towards a sustainable economy within the limited time frame we have left.\n",

    "Pitting these findings against research on general moral behavior creates an insight on the discrepancy between how people usually behave and how those in power do. To start, research shows that test subjects behave morally better in real situations than in imaginary situations, suggesting that people are more moral than they think ()\n",
    "\n",
    "Neurological studies show that people (Crockett et al., 2017) This seems to indicate that the common saying that power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely, is upheld by research. There are indeed plenty of research results that point to the negative effects and abuse of power (Galinsky, Magee, Inesi, Gruenfeld, 2006; Chen et al., 2001; Ng, 1982; Keltner et al., 2003; Bargh, Raymond, Pryor, Strack, 1995; Bugental, 1993) The good news is that this is not always the case, but there are many aspects that need to be taken into account in order to create a comprehensive picture of how power, and its cousin wealth, can have either beneficial, or devastating effects on society.  \n",
    "\n",
    "According to DeCelles et al. (2012), people with strong moral identity are capable of handling power without getting corrupted while those with weaker moral identity are more prone to succumb to corruption, and immoral, and self-serving behavior. However, this does not necessarily mean that people lacking a strong moral identity should be considered immoral. Moral behavior is impacted by how people think about themselves. If they recall a recent moral action, their current day behavior is likely to slide towards more self-serving behavior through \n",

    "Taking all previous findings into account, it is reasonanble to say that society would benefit from structural counter-inequality measures that are implemented at a level that is shielded as much as possible from political power dynamics and their associated ideologies. Central banks define the workings of the momentary system and determine the parameters and interventions of that monetary system by writing them down in monetary policies. Although not completely void of political influence, these monetary policies seem to avoid the large fluctuations that can be observed in social equality measures such as unemployment support, medical support, fair taxes, ... () It is therefore suggesteed that systemic counter-inequality measures are implemented at the level of the monetary system."

    "The link between social ills and inequality are not unilaterally accepted. According to Delhey and Steckermeire (Delhey and Steckermeier, 2020), the role of prosperity can not be ruled out, and . There are other aspects to be considered too. Most research on inequality focuses on income inequality However, this may also be linked to the perception of inequality in wealthier societies since the perception of inequality has a higher psychological influence than the actual level of inequality (up to a point; this needs to be supported with references). \n",
    "\n",
    "- Absolute inequality is not desired (Cappelen et al., 2014; Starmans et al., 2017; Allard and Cova, 2020), which means that the model, with the correct parametrization, might be able to bring inequality down to a fair level.\n",
    "- High inequality has detrimental effects on society. Causal links have been established between high inequality and a plethora of societal ills (Wilkinson and Pickett, 2009). Both mental and physical health are negatively affected (Wilkinson and Pickett, 2006; Pickett and Wilkinson, 2015; Curran and Mahutga, 2018; Wilkinson, 2019), albeit sometimes indirect (Raphael, 2000), thereby increasing healthcare costs. Social mobility, and interaction between social classes is reduced (Kraus et al., 2017), which creates roadblocks for people to exit poverty. Violence increases, which leads to higher government spending on security measures and police forces. Trust in other people, governments and institutions decreases (Oishi et al., 2011), which can lead to social unrest. Social relations weaken, thereby negatively affecting the social fabric that holds society together, and happiness decreases caused by feelings of unfairness and mistrust (Cai et al., 2018), and a higher loss of status effect when looking up on the social ladder than there is a satisfaction effect when looking down (Gao et al., 2022).\n",
    "\n",
    "The real level of inequality is largely misinterpreted by the population at large (Norton and Ariely, 2011; Ziano et al., 2022)\n",
    "\n",
    "Levels of inequality affect what people regard as fair and/or enough, making people in more unequal societies strive more for riches and status than people in more equal societies (Walasek et al., 2018; Goya‐Tocchetto and Payne, 2022; Wang et al., 2023).\n",
    "\n",
    "Living in poverty has a non-trivial effect on those experiencing it. As stated in their book Scarcity (Mullainathan and Shafir, 2021), people living under financial stress suffer from tunnel vision, have a reduced capacity of long-term thinking and even see their IQ drop by about 13 points. All traits that would otherwise help people to escape from poverty. Moreover, people living under financial duress have less leeway for spending mistakes due to a lack of a financial buffer, and lack the funds for investing.\n",

    "It has been proven that, from a quantitative perspective, the monetary system presented in Kuypers, 2024 has the potential to drastically reduce inequality at the systemic level, but inequality is about more than quantitative data. It has a strong psychological component too.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inequality is often underestimated (Norton and Ariely, 2011), and there are indications that perceived inequality and acceptance of existing systems have a more profound effect on people's behavior than actual inequality (Gimpelson and Treisman, 2018; Du and King, 2022; Silagadze et al., 2023). This dynamic is clearly present in societies that have a strong meritocratic ideology. In those societies inequality is higher and so is the resistance against measures that would tackle it, even from those of the lower classes\n",

    "# Further research\n",
    "It would be helpful to determine whether there exists a threshold where an increase, or decrease, in inequality has a measurable effect on perceived inequality. Finding such a threshold would help to determine what the parameters of the model proposed in Kuypers, 2024 need to be in order to have a measurable effect on societal ills caused by real or perceived inequality. It is acknowledged that such research would be complex because cultural and ideological context can have an influence on such a threshold and needs to be taken into account. Collaboration with psychologists, sociologists, and neurologists is therefore advised.\n",
    "\n",
    "In many experiments money cues are often used as a reward/punishment to research behavioral responses to moral choice situations (Kang and Camerer, 2013). Taken the behavioral effects of money itself into account, these studies might have to be revisited in order to determine whether non-monetary rewards-punishments would have the same effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "The design of the monetary system itself might also influence how people react to money cues. Research with complementary currencies indicates that elevated pro-social behavior increases amongst users of these currencies. Whether this is directly linked to the design of these currencies or whether these currencies are used by people who have a stronger tendency towards pro-social behavior requires more research.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another area where further research is needed is to determine how the new model could be introduced, taking into account the power dynamics, and the resulting inequalities that have been created by the current system."
